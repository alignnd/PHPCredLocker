In BETA at the moment, shouldn't be too long until stable. Wouldn't recommend
using in anger just yet as still have a few kinks to work out and backwards
compatability isn't being worried about at this early stage!

I'm not an interface designer, so the template is very rough around the edges.
It's designed to support custom templates though so you can skin and brand as
you see fit
